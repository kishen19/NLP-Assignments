# Sentiment Analysis

Check the report for description of model used.

### Prerequisites:
- Scikt-learn
- google-cloud-translate

Check the Sentiment analysis notebook, everything is well-commented and easily understandable.

[Note: I have not uploaded the google-translate code, as it requires cloud access api key. It is simple,once you setup your service account on google cloud. Just get a api key and use it. The documentation of google-cloud-translate can be found <a href="https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-translate/" >here</a>]
